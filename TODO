* Main code
** Respect attackers dice choice
** Test bench code and player tracking (Object v String) is so hideous, it makes my eyes bleed

* Web page UI
** Allow selection of AIs for other players
** Refactor status.js into more objects
** Switch around attacks: pick attack, after countries, pick all-out or one time
** Start putting in some CSS
