* Main code
** Respect attackers dice choice
** Make sure all player status update events are handled and published
** Should be able to start new game without restarting server (initialize crapola)
** Need to be able to determine when there's a draw: 50 moves without an attack?

* Web page UI
** Allow selection of AIs for other players
** Refactor status.js into more objects
** Switch around attacks: pick attack, after countries, pick all-out or one time
** Start putting in some CSS
** Correct flaw when 3 digit armies uglify country on canvas
