* Main code
** Respect attackers dice choice
** Test bench code and player tracking (Object v String) is so hideous, it makes my eyes bleed

* Web UI
** Still need massive improvements to game creation, starting, etc
** Refactor status.js into more objects
** Switch around attacks: pick attack, after countries, pick all-out or one time
** Start putting in some CSS

* AIs
** Second generation of AIs
*** Wimpy: Attack if huge advantage is detected
*** Grumpy: Be a bit more circumspect
*** Bully: Make useful fortification moves
*** Grabby: Do not completely ignore secondary continents
*** Tuney: better recognize when a player is almost dead or a continent almost conquered
